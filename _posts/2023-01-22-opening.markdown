Why am I writing a blog? No one knows; I never liked writing.

Having a blog, however, has always been the kind of informal thing I could do - something that just stays in the back of your mind for some time ("how cool would it be to have a blog myself?").

I also found out lately that sometimes it can help get things out of my head and clarify concepts.

And what is the best time of the year to get things out of my head other than the beginning of a new year?

When doing something you've never done before, there's always learning involved. And questions arise. What could a good title be? And what about the first post? What would I be talking about?

The title was easy. It kind of felt good to name it after the first song on Linkin Park's [Reanimation](https://open.spotify.com/album/2NbO8RRVTVEUjHaxUVdMDT?si=560f2b7c795b4d96), one of my favorite albums.

So, what about the content? Void.

Yes, that's it. My first article contains no content! :-)

Sure, this just means deferring a couple of days the real first post. But at least I got started!
